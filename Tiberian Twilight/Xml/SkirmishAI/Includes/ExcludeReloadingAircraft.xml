	<!-- The AI often needs to exclude reloading aircraft from most of its states, because it needs special states to handle the reloading
	     correctly. (Without this, either the aircraft never reload because they keep getting other orders, or everything else sits idle while
				the aircraft go back to reload.) This is an object filter which gets all objects except those reloading aircraft -->
