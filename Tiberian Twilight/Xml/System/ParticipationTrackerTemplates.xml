	KilledObjectExperienceMultiplier
		This effects the amount of experience awarded for units/structures that 
		are killed, but do not have an explicit player participation 
		(experience) value.  The experience given will be calculated by 
		multiplying this attribute by the build time of the unit.
		
	MonumentDamageExperienceThreshold
		This determines how frequently experience is awarded for damaging the 
		monument object.  It's represents a percentage of the monument's health.
		For example, the value 10.0 means every time the monument loses 10% of 
		it's health, it will award experience to the enemy team. Each time it 
		crosses a 10% boundary (90%, 80%, 70%, etc.), the experience will be
		awarded.  The 10% of damage does not need to be done in one blow.
		
	MonumentDamageAward
		The amount of experience awarded when each 
		MonumentDamageExperienceThreshold is crossed.  This is awarded to each
		player on the enemy team.
